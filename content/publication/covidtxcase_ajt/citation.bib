TI  - Prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 persistence, attenuated 
      immunologic response, and viral evolution in a solid organ transplant patient.

AB  - Unlike immunocompetent hosts, the duration of viral persistence after infection with 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can be prolonged in immunosuppressed 
      patients. Here, we present a case of viral persistence for over 19 weeks in a 
      patient with a history of solid organ transplant and explore the clinical, 
      virologic, and immunologic course. Our patient still demonstrated viral persistence 
      at 138 days with low polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values and evidence 
      of continuing viral sequence evolution indicative of ongoing virus replication. 
      These findings have important implications for infection prevention and control 
      recommendations in immunosuppressed patients. Immune response, including 
      neutralizing antibody titers, T cell activity, and cytokine levels, peaked around 
      days 44-72 after diagnosis. Anti-S trimer antibodies were low at all time points, 
      and T cell response was attenuated by day 119. As immune response waned and viral 
      load increased, increased genetic diversity emerged, suggesting a mechanism for the 
      development of viral variants.
