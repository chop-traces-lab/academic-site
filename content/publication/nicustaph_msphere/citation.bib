      Staphylococcus aureus Clones from a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Surveillance 
      Effort.

AB  - Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is a more prevalent neonatal 
      intensive care unit (NICU) pathogen than methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 
      However, the introduction and spread of MSSA, the role of systematic 
      decolonization, and optimal infection prevention and control strategies remain 
      incompletely understood. We previously screened infants hospitalized in a 
      university-affiliated level III to IV NICU twice monthly over 18â€‰months for S. 
      aureus colonization and identified several prevalent staphylococcal protein A 
      (spa) types. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic 
      comparisons of 140 isolates from predominant spa types t279, t1451, and t571 to 
      examine possible transmission routes and identify genomic and epidemiologic 
      features associated with the spread of dominant clones. We identified two major 
      MSSA clones: sequence type 398 (ST398), common in the local community, and 
      ST1898, not previously encountered in the region. ST398 NICU isolates formed 
      distinct clusters with closely related community isolates from previously 
      published data sets, suggesting multiple sources of acquisition, such as family 
      members or staff, including residents of the local community. In contrast, ST1898 
      isolates were nearly identical, pointing to clonal expansion within the NICU. 
      Almost all ST1898 isolates harbored plasmids encoding mupirocin resistance 
      (mupA), suggesting an association between the proliferation of this clone and 
      decolonization efforts with mupirocin. Comparative genomics indicated 
      genotype-specific pathways of introduction and spread of MSSA via 
      community-associated (ST398) or health care-associated (ST1898) sources and the 
      potential role of mupirocin resistance in dissemination of ST1898. Future 
      surveillance efforts could benefit from routine genotyping to inform 
      clone-specific infection prevention strategies. IMPORTANCE 
      Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is a significant pathogen in 
      neonates. However, surveillance efforts in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) 
      have focused primarily on methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), limiting our 
      understanding of colonizing and infectious MSSA clones which are prevalent in the 
      NICU. Here, we identify two dominant colonizing MSSA clones during an 18-month 
      surveillance effort in a level III to IV NICU, ST398 and ST1898. Using genomic 
      surveillance and phylogenetic analysis, coupled with epidemiological 
      investigation, we found that these two sequence types had distinct modes of 
      spread, namely the suggested exchange with community reservoirs for ST398 and the 
      contribution of antibiotic resistance to dissemination of ST1898 in the health 
      care setting. This study highlights the additional benefits of whole-genome 
      surveillance for colonizing pathogens, beyond routine species identification and 
      genotyping, to inform targeted infection prevention strategies.
