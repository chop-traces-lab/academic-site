abstract: ! "<strong>Background</strong>: Staphylococcus aureus protein A (*spa*) typing can be used to expand characterization of the epidemiology of methicillin-susceptible *S. aureus* (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) in neonatal intensive care units (NICU).  
<strong>Methods</strong>: From January 2017 to June 2018, twice-monthly surveillance for *S. aureus* was performed in an academically affiliated NICU. Decolonization of infants colonized with *S. aureus* included chlorhexidine gluconate bathing and/or mupirocin for those with mupirocin-susceptible strains. *Spa* typing and mupirocin-resistance testing were performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between infants colonized with MSSA vs MRSA and infants with and without the most common MSSA *spa* type, MSSA-t279.  
<strong>Results</strong>: Overall, 14% and 2% of 1556 hospitalized infants had positive surveillance cultures for MSSA and MRSA, respectively. Thirty-six infants harbored unique MSSA *spa* types, 5 infants harbored unique MRSA *spa* types, and 30 MSSA and 6 MRSA *spa* types were identified in ???2 infants. No outbreaks were identified during the study period. MSSA-t279 was isolated from 3% of infants and largely detected from infants hospitalized in one section of the NICU; 96% of t279 isolates were mupirocin resistant. Infection rates, length of hospitalization, and mortality were similar among infants initially colonized with t279 vs other MSSA *spa* types.  
<strong>Conclusions</strong>: The MSSA colonization burden was 5-fold larger than that of MRSA. Numerous unique *spa* types were identified. The most common *spa* type, MSSA-t279, was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality but was mupirocin resistant and associated with clustered NICU beds. This suggests potential transmission from the environment, shared staff, and/or workflow issues requiring further study. Other decolonization strategies for *S. aureus* in the NICU are needed."
