abstract: ! "<strong>Reacting rationally</strong><br>During the 1e oxidation of ferrocyanide by the catalytic TAML activator and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, four Fe<sup>IV</sup> tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand (TAML) intermediates were detected that are involved in a fast acidâ€“base equilibrium. The counterintuitive reactivity pattern is explained by the overall free-energy change during the reduction of Fe<sup>IV</sup> to Fe<sup>III</sup> TAML complexes, with competing contributions from electronic and solvation energy changes."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: ! "In the first in-depth study of the reactivity of the oxidized TAML species, the non-monotonic reactivity pattern could be explained by the presence of competing contributions from the electronic and the solvation energy change to the overall free energy change for the redox process."
