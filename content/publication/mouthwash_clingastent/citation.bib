AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although the microbiome is altered in various esophageal diseases, 
      there is no direct evidence for a link between the oral or esophageal microbiome and 
      underlying esophageal tissue. Here, we aimed to address these gaps through use of an 
      antimicrobial mouth rinse to modify the esophageal microbiome and tissue gene 
      expression. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, patients scheduled to 
      undergo endoscopy for clinical indications used chlorhexidine mouth rinse or no 
      treatment for 2 weeks before endoscopy. Oral swabs and saliva were collected at 
      baseline and at follow-up, and the esophagus was sampled on the day of endoscopy. 
      The microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and esophageal tissue gene 
      expression was ascertained by RNA-Seq. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled and 
      included in the analyses. Within individuals, the oral and esophageal microbiome 
      composition was significantly correlated. Chlorhexidine treatment associated with 
      significant alterations to the relative abundance of several esophageal bacterial 
      taxa, and to expression of genes in the esophagus including reductions in periostin, 
      claudin-18, chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL13, and several members of the tumor necrosis 
      factor receptor superfamily. A taxon in genus Haemophilus in the esophagus also 
      associated with significant changes in tissue gene expression. DISCUSSION: The oral 
      and esophageal microbiomes are closely related within individuals, and esophageal 
      microbiome alterations correlate with tissue gene expression changes. The esophageal 
      microbiome may act as an important cofactor that influences pathogenesis and 
      outcomes of diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and 
      Barrett's esophagus.
