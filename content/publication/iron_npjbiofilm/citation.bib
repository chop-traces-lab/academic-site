abstract = {Iron is essential for both microorganisms and their hosts. Although effects of dietary iron on gut microbiota have been described, the effect of systemic iron administration has yet to be explored. Here, we show that dietary iron, intravenous iron administration, and chronic transfusion in mice increase the availability of iron in the gut. These iron interventions have consistent and reproducible effects on the murine gut microbiota; specifically, relative abundance of the Parabacteroides and Lactobacillus genera negatively correlate with increased iron stores, whereas members of the Clostridia class positively correlate with iron stores regardless of the route of iron administration. Iron levels also affected microbial metabolites, in general, and indoles, in particular, circulating in host plasma and in stool pellets. Taken together, these results suggest that by shifting the balance of the microbiota, clinical interventions that affect iron status have the potential to alter biologically relevant microbial metabolites in the host.},
