AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are highly concerning MDR 
      pathogens. Horizontal transfer of broad-host-range IncN plasmids may contribute 
      to the dissemination of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), spreading 
      carbapenem resistance among unrelated bacteria. However, the population structure 
      and genetic diversity of IncN plasmids has not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: 
      We reconstructed blaKPC-harbouring IncN plasmid genomes to characterize shared 
      gene content, structural variability, and putative horizontal transfer within and 
      across patients and diverse bacterial clones. METHODS: We performed short- and 
      long-read sequencing and hybrid assembly on 45 CRE isolates with 
      blaKPC-harbouring IncN plasmids. Eight serial isolates from two patients were 
      included to assess intra-patient plasmid dynamics. Comparative genomic analysis 
      was performed to assess structural and sequence similarity across plasmids. 
      Within IncN sublineages defined by plasmid MLST and kmer-based clustering, 
      phylogenetic analysis was used to identify closely related plasmids. RESULTS: 
      Comparative analysis of IncN plasmid genomes revealed substantial heterogeneity 
      including large rearrangements in serial patient plasmids and differences in 
      structure and content across plasmid clusters. Within plasmid sublineages, core 
      genome content and resistance gene regions were largely conserved. Closely 
      related plasmids (≤1 SNP) were found in highly diverse isolates, including ten 
      pST6 plasmids found in eight bacterial clones from three different species. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Genomic analysis of blaKPC-harbouring IncN plasmids revealed the 
      presence of several distinct sublineages as well as substantial host diversity 
      within plasmid clusters suggestive of frequent mobilization. This study reveals 
      complex plasmid dynamics within a single plasmid family, highlighting the 
      challenge of tracking plasmid-mediated transmission of blaKPC in clinical 
      settings.
