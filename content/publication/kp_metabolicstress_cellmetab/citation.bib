AB  - K. pneumoniae sequence type 258 (Kp ST258) is a major cause of 
      healthcare-associated pneumonia. However, it remains unclear how it causes 
      protracted courses of infection in spite of its expression of immunostimulatory 
      lipopolysaccharide, which should activate a brisk inflammatory response and 
      bacterial clearance. We predicted that the metabolic stress induced by the 
      bacteria in the host cells shapes an immune response that tolerates infection. We 
      combined in situ metabolic imaging and transcriptional analyses to demonstrate 
      that Kp ST258 activates host glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This 
      response creates an oxidant-rich microenvironment conducive to the accumulation 
      of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. In this setting, metabolically active Kp 
      ST258 elicits a disease-tolerant immune response. The bacteria, in turn, adapt to 
      airway oxidants by upregulating the type VI secretion system, which is highly 
      conserved across ST258 strains worldwide. Thus, much of the global success of Kp 
      ST258 in hospital settings can be explained by the metabolic activity provoked in 
      the host that promotes disease tolerance.
