AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based tests are well-calibrated to infectiousness 
      and have a critical role to play in the COVID-19 public health response. We 
      report the development and performance of a unique lateral flow immunoassay 
      (LFA). METHODS: Combinations of several monoclonal antibodies targeting multiple 
      antigenic sites on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) were isolated, 
      evaluated, and chosen for the development of a LFA termed CoV-SCAN (BioMedomics, 
      Inc.). Clinical point-of-care studies in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals 
      were conducted to evaluate positive predictive agreement (PPA) and negative 
      predictive agreement (NPA) with RT-PCR as comparator. RESULTS: In laboratory 
      testing, CoV-SCAN detected 14 recombinant N-proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants with 
      sensitivity in the range of 0.2-3.2 ng/mL, and 10 authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants 
      with sensitivity in the range of 1.6-12.5 TCID50/swab. No cross reactivity was 
      observed with other human coronaviruses or other respiratory pathogens. In 
      clinical point-of-care testing on 148 individuals over age 2 with symptoms of ≤5 
      days, PPA was 87.2% (CI 95: 78.3-94.8%) and NPA was 100% (CI 95: 94.2-100%). In 
      another 884 asymptomatic individuals, PPA was 85.7% (CI 95: 42.1-99.6%) and 99.7% 
      (99.0-99.9%). Overall, CoV-SCAN detected over 97.2% of specimens with CT values 
      <30 and 93.8% of nasal swab specimens with the Omicron variant, even within the 
      first 2 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: The unique construction of 
      CoV-SCAN using two pairs of monoclonal antibodies has resulted in a test with 
      high performance that remains durable across multiple variants in both laboratory 
      and clinical evaluations. CoV-SCAN should identify almost all individuals 
      harboring infectious SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: Unique construction of a point-of-care 
      rapid antigen test using two pairs of monoclonal antibodies has led to good 
      performance that remained durable across multiple variants in laboratory and 
      clinical evaluations. Test should identify almost all individuals harboring 
      infectious SARS-CoV-2.
