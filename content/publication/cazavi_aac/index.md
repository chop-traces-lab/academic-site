abstract: ! "Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a promising novel treatment for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Despite improved treatment outcomes compared to those achieved with aminoglycoside- and colistin-based regimens, the rapid evolution of CAZ-AVI resistance during treatment has previously been reported in *Klebsiella pneumoniae* sequence type 258 (ST258) *bla*<sub>KPC-3</sub>-harboring isolates. Here, we report the stepwise evolution and isolation of two phenotypically distinct CAZ-AVI-resistant *Klebsiella pneumoniae* isolates from a patient with pancreatitis. All susceptible (n = 3) and resistant (n = 5) isolates were of the ST307 clonal background, a rapidly emerging clone. Taking advantage of short-read Illumina and long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing and full-length assembly of the core chromosome and plasmids, we demonstrate that CAZ-AVI resistance first occurred through a 532G → T *bla*<sub>KPC-2</sub> point mutation in *bla*<sub>KPC-2</sub> (D179Y protein substitution) following only 12 days of CAZ-AVI exposure. While subsequent isolates exhibited substantially decreased meropenem (MEM) MICs (≤2 μg/ml), later cultures demonstrated a second CAZ-AVI resistance phenotype with a lower CAZ-AVI MIC (12 μg/ml) but also MEM resistance (MIC > 128 μg/ml). These CAZ-AVI- and MEM-resistant isolates showed evidence of multiple genomic adaptations, mainly through insertions and deletions. This included amplification and transposition of wild-type *bla*<sub>KPC-2</sub> into a novel plasmid, an IS1 insertion upstream of *ompK36*, and disruption of the *rfb* gene locus in these isolates. Our findings illustrate the potential of CAZ-AVI resistance to emerge in non-*K. pneumoniae* ST258 clonal backgrounds and alternative *bla*<sub>KPC</sub> variants. These results raise concerns about the strong selective pressures incurred by novel carbapenemase inhibitors, such as avibactam, on isolates previously considered invulnerable to CAZ-AVI resistance. There is an urgent need to further characterize non-KPC-mediated modes of carbapenem resistance and the intrinsic bacterial factors that facilitate the rapid emergence of resistance during treatment."
