abstract: ! "Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are limited. While *Klebsiella pneumoniae* strains harboring *bla*<sub>KPC</sub> account for most CRE, recent evidence points to increasing diversification of CRE. We determined whether the CRE species and antibiotic resistance genotype influence the response to relebactam (REL), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor with class A//C activity, combined with imipenem-cilastatin (IMI). We carried out broth microdilution testing with IMI alone or in the presence of 4 μg/ml REL against 154 clinical isolates collected at a New York City hospital with a high prevalence of organisms carrying *bla*<sub>KPC</sub>, including *Enterobacter* spp. (n = 96), *K. pneumoniae* (n = 44), *Escherichia coli* (n = 1), *Serratia marcescens* (n = 9), and *Citrobacter* spp. (n = 4). Resistance gene profiles and the presence of major porin gene disruptions were ascertained by whole-genome sequencing. Addition of REL decreased the IMI MIC to the susceptible range (≤1 μg/ml) against 88% of isolates. However, *S. marcescens* IMI-REL MICs were 4- to 8-fold higher than those for other organisms. Most *bla*<sub>KPC</sub>-positive isolates had IMI-REL MICs of ≤1 μg/ml (88%), including isolates of *Enterobacter cloacae* ST171 (93%) and *K. pneumoniae* ST258 (82%). Nineteen isolates had IMI-REL MICs of ≥2 μg/ml, among which 84% harbored *bla*<sub>KPC</sub> and one was *bla*<sub>NDM-1</sub> positive. Isolates with IMI-REL MICs of ≥2 μg/ml versus those with MICs of ≤1 μg/ml were significantly more likely to demonstrate disruption of at least one porin gene (42% versus 19%; P = 0.04), although most *S. marcescens* isolates (67%) had intact porin genes. In conclusion, while REL reduced IMI MICs in a majority of diverse CRE isolates, including high-risk clones, chromosomal factors had an impact on IMI-REL susceptibilities and may contribute to elevated MICs for *S. marcescens*."
