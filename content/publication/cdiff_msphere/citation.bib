AB  - Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has a higher incidence in solid organ 
      transplant recipients than other hospitalized patients and can lead to poor 
      outcomes. Perturbations to the intestinal microbiome are common in patients 
      undergoing liver transplant (LT); however, the impacts of microbial diversity and 
      composition on risk of CDI in this patient population is incompletely understood. 
      Here, we assessed patients in an established, longitudinal LT cohort for 
      development of CDI within 1 year of transplant. Clinical data were compared for 
      patients with and without CDI using univariable models. 16S rRNA sequencing of 
      fecal samples was performed at multiple pre- and posttransplant time points to 
      compare microbiome α- and β-diversity and enrichment of specific taxa in patients 
      with and without CDI. Of 197 patients who underwent LT, 18 (9.1%) developed CDI 
      within 1 year. Pre-LT Child-Pugh class C liver disease, postoperative biliary 
      leak, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were significantly associated with 
      CDI. Patients who developed CDI had significantly lower α-diversity than patients 
      without CDI overall and in samples collected at months 1, 3, and 6. Microbial 
      composition (β-diversity) differed between patients with and without CDI and 
      across sampling time points, particularly later in their posttransplant course. 
      We also identified 15 (8%) patients with toxigenic C. difficile colonization who 
      did not develop CDI and may have had additional protective factors. In summary, 
      clinical and microbiome factors are likely to converge to impart CDI risk. Along 
      with enhanced preventive measures, there may be a role for microbiome modulation 
      to restore microbial diversity in high-risk LT patients. IMPORTANCE Liver 
      transplant (LT) recipients have high rates of Clostridioides difficile infection 
      (CDI), which has been associated with poor outcomes, including graft-related 
      complications and mortality, in prior studies. Susceptibility to CDI is known to 
      increase following perturbations in intestinal commensal bacteria that enable 
      germination of C. difficile spores and bacterial overgrowth. In LT patients, 
      changes in the intestinal microbiome resulting from advanced liver disease, 
      surgery, and other clinical factors is common and most pronounced during the 
      early posttransplant period. However, the relationship between microbiome changes 
      and CDI risk after LT remains unclear. In this study, we investigated clinical 
      and microbiome factors associated with development of CDI within the first year 
      after LT. The importance of this work is to identify patients with high-risk 
      features that should receive enhanced preventive measures and may benefit from 
      the study of novel strategies to reconstitute the intestinal microbiome after LT.
