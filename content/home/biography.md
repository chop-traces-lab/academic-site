<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">I have always been in awe of, and inspired by, what microorganisms can do to and for us humans. I am currently a <a href = "https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/services/tl1-training-programs">TRANSFORM TL1</a>-funded Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with <a href = "https://www.infectiousdiseases.cumc.columbia.edu/research-labs/uhlemann-lab">Dr. Anne-Catrin Uhlemann</a> at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. As a microbiologist and engineer, I have a background in pathogen genomics and multidrug resistance, human and environmental microbiomes, and engineering of biological processes.</p> 

<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">My recent focus has been the complex relationships between commensal and pathogenic organisms in the human microbiome. Specifically, I study how oral and gut microbiota modulate the emergence and clearance of multidrug-resistant organisms in immunocompromised hosts. My future research interests lie at the intersection of environmental bioprocess engineering and the relationship between the human microbiome and antimicrobial resistance.</p>
